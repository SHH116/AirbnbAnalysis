# Applying Business Analytics to identify KPIs contributing to Airbnb price premium 

As the Airbnb market gets more competitive and more hosts join the network, it becomes important to identify the key factors which help the hosts ask a higher price premium. I extract some of those factors based on the Seattle market data. Later, I run some comparative studies of the successful hosts vs the unsuccessful ones.
